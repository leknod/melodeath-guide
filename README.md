Albums are displayed in **chronological order**, starting from the early 1990s.

## üí° Why I built this
This is my **first full project** using React and Tailwind. I‚Äôm using it as a learning experience while building something I'm passionate about.

This project comes from two personal passions:

1. **Melodic death metal**, especially the 90s scene  
2. **Modern web development**, which I'm currently learning

It‚Äôs a way to practice coding while giving back to a genre I like.
