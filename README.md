## 💡 Why I built this
This is my **first full project** using React and Tailwind. I’m using it as a learning experience while building something I'm passionate about.

This project comes from two personal passions:

1. **Melodic death metal**, especially the 90s scene  
2. **Modern web development**, which I'm currently learning

It’s a way to practice coding while giving back to a genre I like.
